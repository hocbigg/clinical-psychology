# Summary

The Clinical Psychology curriculum is a **complete education in Clinical Psychology** using online materials.

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

# Organization

- **Intro Clinical Psychology**: Orientation to psychology as a science, the clinical subfield, and essential academic skills.
- **Core Clinical Psychology**: Foundational coursework covering psychological science, psychopathology, assessment, statistics, neuroscience, development, social foundations, and ethics.
- **Advanced Clinical Psychology**: Domain-focused upper-level electives organized into several specialization tracks.
- **Final Project**: A capstone research or applied project demonstrating integrative knowledge.

**Duration**. **1–2 years** at **~20 hours/week** (40–50 learning weeks/year). The roadmap below is sequenced for sustainability, but you can slow down or accelerate as needed.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week. A popular option is to take the math courses in parallel with the introductory courses. Course prerequisites are listed to help you determine if you are prepared for a given course.
- Courses in Advanced are electives. Choose one subject you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading.

## Final Project (Capstone)

The capstone demonstrates integrated knowledge. It can be **research-based** or **applied clinical-science** (non-clinical practice, as licensure requires supervision).

### Goals

- Synthesize knowledge from Intro, Core, and Advanced work.
- Apply scientific reasoning and psychological theory to a topic.
- Produce a scholarly artifact suitable for peer review or portfolio demonstration.

### Acceptable project types

- A full **research proposal** (Introduction, Literature Review, Methods, Expected Results, Discussion).
- A **secondary data analysis** using open datasets (e.g., ICPSR, NIH, OpenNeuro).
- A **case-conceptualization portfolio** (hypothetical cases only).
- A **systematic mini-review** of evidence-based treatment for a specific disorder.
- A **public-facing educational resource** grounded in clinical science (website, handbook, curriculum).

### Structure

1. **Proposal (2–3 weeks)**
Identify topic, research questions, theoretical framework, and justification.

2. **Literature Review (3–4 weeks)**
Source 15–30 peer-reviewed articles and synthesize them.

3. **Method or Application Design (3–5 weeks)**

- For research: design study, measures, analytic plan.
- For applied: design case conceptualization, protocols, or resource.

4. **Final Manuscript (3–5 weeks)**
3,500–6,000 words; APA style recommended.

5. **Peer-Review Simulation (1–2 weeks)**
Exchange feedback in online forums, Discord communities, or study groups.

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Literary Theory.
Congratulations!
